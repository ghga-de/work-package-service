# Work Package Service

Work Package Service

## Description

The work package service allows creating work packages for downloading or
uploading dataset files and provides an authorization mechanism for these tasks
by issuing access and work order tokens.

### API endpoints:

#### `POST /work-packages`

Creates a work package.

- auth header: internal access token
- request body:
  - `dataset_id`: string (the ID of a dataset)
  - `type`: enum (download/upload)
  - `file_ids`: array of strings  (null = all files of the dataset)
  - `user_public_crypt4gh_key`: string (the user's public Crypt4GH key)
- response body:
  - `id`: string (the ID of the created work package)
  - `token`: string (encrypted work and base64 encoded package access token)

####  `GET /work-packages/{work_package_id}`

Gets details on the specified work package.

- auth header: work package access token

#### `POST /work-packages/{work_package_id}/files/{file_id}/work-order-tokens`

 Creates an encrypted work order token for the specified work package and file.

- auth header: work package access token

#### `GET /users/{user_id}/datasets`

Gets a list of all dataset IDs that can be downloaded by the user.

- auth header: internal access token with the user context


## Installation

We recommend using the provided Docker container.

A pre-build version is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ghga/work-package-service):
```bash
docker pull ghga/work-package-service:1.0.1
```

Or you can build the container yourself from the [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile):
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
docker build -t ghga/work-package-service:1.0.1 .
```

For production-ready deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes, however,
for simple use cases, you could execute the service using docker
on a single server:
```bash
# The entrypoint is preconfigured:
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghga/work-package-service:1.0.1 --help
```

If you prefer not to use containers, you may install the service from source:
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
pip install .

# To run the service:
wps --help
```

### Usage:

A template YAML for configurating the service can be found at
[`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml).
Please adapt it, rename it to `.wps.yaml`, and place it into one of the following locations:
- in the current working directory were you are execute the service (on unix: `./.wps.yaml`)
- in your home directory (on unix: `~/.wps.yaml`)

The config yaml will be automatically parsed by the service.

**Important: If you are using containers, the locations refer to paths within the container.**

All parameters mentioned in the [`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml)
could also be set using environment variables or file secrets.

For naming the environment variables, just prefix the parameter name with `wps_`,
e.g. for the `host` set an environment variable named `wps_host`
(you may use both upper or lower cases, however, it is standard to define all env
variables in upper cases).

To using file secrets please refer to the
[corresponding section](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/#secret-support)
of the pydantic documentation.

## HTTP API
An OpenAPI specification for this service can be found [here](./openapi.yaml).

## Architecture and Design:
This is a Python-based service following the Triple Hexagonal Architecture pattern.
It uses protocol/provider pairs and dependency injection mechanisms provided by the
[hexkit](https://github.com/ghga-de/hexkit) library.


## Development

For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of VS Code
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as VS Code with its "Remote - Containers"
extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in VS Code and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the VS Code "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant VS Code extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formatting
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, a convenience commands `dev_install` is available.
It installs the service with all development dependencies, installs pre-commit.

The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,
if you update dependencies in the [`./pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) or the
[`./requirements-dev.txt`](./requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.
